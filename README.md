# FTP Client

This project aims to build an ftp client which is similar to the ftp client in Linux.

Now finished part of the base framework,
and can run some simple commands including 
`open`, `user`, `get`, `put`, `close`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `pwd`,
`ascii`, `bin`, `cd`, `cdup`, `exit`, `ls`, etc.

Just support **passive mode** now.

Need `JDK 1.8` to build.

Run `mvn package` to build a runnable jar file.
